# Logan's Spotify Music Controller
This is a revised version of my project after the initial review. I switched the XIAO Rp2040 to an XIAO ESP32-C3 which has wifi capabilities so it is able to control spotify over wi-fi. The oled will show what song is playing and the artist, the buttons control the music: skipping a song, turning on or off shuffle, playing a playlist, etc..) journal is avaliable at https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/6103

# Logan's Budget Stream Deck
This is the first custom project that I made entirely myself with blueprint. I wanted a stream deck but did not want to pay $150, so I thought it would be cool to try and make my own. So here is my attempt at a "budget" stream deck with 8 switches, a rotary encoder and an oled screen. all programmable. The BOM is viewable below or downloadable in excel or pdf format to access the links.
my journal and progress is avaliable at https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/6103
